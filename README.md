# Angular Basics Exercises

## Overview

In these exercises, I practice creating an Angular project from scratch.  I practiced creating new components both manually and with the Angular CLI.  As a bonus, I added Bootstrap styling to the project.

After the setup, I worked within the components to display text and got experience with string interpolation `{{}}`, property binding `[]`, event binding `()`, and two-way data binding `[()]`.

## Reflection

This was fun!  I (geekily so) really like working with components and how they nest in the `app-root`.  Although there are a lot of files, I like the reusability of individual components and the organization of the file structure.  I can see where, as a project gets larger, it's nice to have many smaller files that are clearly labeled versus the standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript biggies.  

I do see Angular as being a type of framework that requires consistent practice to get comfortable with the concepts and the syntax.  I'm excited to give that consistent effort towards learning this framework over the next few months.  I think that learning Angular and getting comfortable with it will then help me move over to React, Vue, and other frameworks as needed down the road.
